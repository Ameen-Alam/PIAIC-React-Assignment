# React-Redux-TypeScript-Template

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. ... You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.


TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking. TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand. With TypeScript, we can make a huge improvement over plain JavaScript. TypeScript gives us all the benefits of ES6 (ECMAScript 6), plus more productivity.
