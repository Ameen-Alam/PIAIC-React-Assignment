# React-ContextAPI-and-Hooks

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.<br/>
The Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, which enables us to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application. It's aimed at solving the problem of prop drilling. ... Libraries like Redux allows you to get data from the store easily, anywhere in the tree.
